The goal of revise is to support authors in responding to revise and resubmit requests. These functions are designed to work with [crsh/papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja).

## Installation

You can install the development version of {revise} from [GitHub](https://github.com/conig/revise) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("conig/revise")
```
# Starting a revision document

## ReviewerComment addin

We have included an addin so you can mark text as a reviewer comment. If a YAML header is not detected in document the addin will add it. Fields will automatically be filled in if there is a .rmd file in the working directory. Additionally, selected text will be marked as a reviewer comment by including it within an "asis" chunk. Text below this chunk will be tagged as an author response. A hotkey can be set for this addin (e.g. Ctrl+Shift+R).

# Loading a manuscript

You can use rmd or docx files with revise. To load either, simply call revise::read_manuscript("your_file.rmd")

For example. Here is an example docx where content has been tagged with comment boxes. E.g, Revise::hard
```{r}
docx_path <- system.file("examples/word_test.docx", package = "revise")

man <- read_manuscript(docx_path)
man
```

We can see all tagged sections by running

```{r}
names(man$sections)
```

Then we can retrieve using a section name

```{r}
revision <- get_revision("hard", man)
revision
```

This content can then be put directly into a response document using single backticks.
